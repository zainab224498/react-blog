      "body": "It was a tug-of-war between the Jesus People and the New Age Movement.\n\nAlex Absalom uncovers the roots of what would grow into a church planting movement by pulling stories from Ralph Moore.\n\nDispelling Doubt and Disillusionment\nThe story starts with doubt and disillusionment as our country turned away from the church as much as it does today. Secularism rose quickly, and so did interest in Eastern religions. Young people followed the Beatles and other rockers into drugs and new-age thought.\n\nA book called New Testament Fire in the Philippines opened a young man’s mind to new paradigms of disciplemaking and even church growth in otherwise dark days.\n\nThe interview delves into young people experiencing radical prayer miracles—even demon deliverance and many stories of faith-induced escape from hard drugs. The supernatural was the power driving the movement. As thousands found Christ, disciplemaking followed, often through Navigator-inspired Bible studies.\n\nFaith, Youth Groups and Church Growth\nThere is the story of a young student deciding to follow Christ while simultaneously following Fidel Castro and similar role models. Snared into disciplemaking sessions at the beach, she blossomed into a singer, effective evangelist and disciplemaker. Her converts evangelized, and a small church youth group grew into a forceful Jesus People entity. Leading that youth group laid a foundation for a later disciplemaking movement in Moore’s first church plant.\n\nChurch Planting, Spiritual Transformation and Demonic Influence\nThe first Hope Chapel was born of just a dozen people meeting in a closed church building.\n\nThe Spirit moved in a tiny congregation heavily influenced by Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel. Fun-filled, simple Bible teaching in the pulpit and a heavy reliance on the works of the Spirit in the hippy years differentiated the church to the point of ridicule by local pastors.\n\nOne radically saved young man demanded that another “get in the truck because Jesus told me to give you a ride wherever you’re going.” The guy was going less than 300 feet from where he was picked up. However, the pickup drive left him with a cartoon tract about Jesus, which he only read after hitchhiking 1,200 miles to Washington State. Back in Hermosa Beach months later, he showed up at the door of the church stoned, drunk and demonized.\n\nHe left clean and on fire for Jesus. Months later, he confessed to having burglarized the church months before his encounter with the pickup-driving evangelist.",

      "body": "The emerging generation will be inspired if they are given the opportunity to demonstrate leadership. It is a difficult transition for the older generation to relinquish control of how things happen. It means that changes will be instituted that make older adults uncomfortable at times. The strongest leaders will be those who can speak in the multiple “languages” necessary to communicate to everyone. This is usually not something that can be learned, but is an intuitive aspect of growing up as a bicultural kid. Consider the process of older adults learning to use a smartphone. They don’t turn to their spouse for help, but rather their children or grandchildren. These kids know how to operate the technology, as well as how to communicate to the adults about its use.\n\nAs the culture continues to evolve, younger people understand it innately and how to explain to previous generations what is occurring. This is where bicultural communication is key for the church. The only ones capable of doing that well are young people. It means that if the church is going to evolve, emerging generations must be given the opportunity to lead those changes, helping to transform the church into a body better able to engage with its altered surroundings.\n\n“Keychain leadership” is a term developed by Kara Powell and her team at the Fuller Youth Institute. It describes the willingness of those holding all the “keys”—of access, decision making, strategic planning, and critical roles or authority—to hand over the keys and empower multiple people in areas of leadership, including those within emerging generations (Growing Young, 2016). Often those leaders who fail to share leadership for various functions of the church are concerned with controlling what is produced and need to feel that they themselves are critical to the success of any venture. But the willingness to involve people at multiple levels, to encourage those currently in roles of passive participation toward invested responsibility, fosters a sense of ownership and belonging that is particularly attractive to young adults. The results of research by Faith Communities Today verify the assumptions behind keychain leadership. They found that emerging generations have a stronger commitment and connection to congregations when they receive multiple opportunities for involvement in addition to weekly corporate worship.

      "body": "This is a response from John Honold to the three blogs regarding Paul and his time in the school of Tyrannus.\n\nMy model church in the Book of Acts has been Antioch – a church that “evangelized” [Acts 11:21], “organized” [Acts 11:26], and “deputized” [Acts 13:2-3] with a result of the incredible spread of the Gospel in the 1st Century.\n\nHowever, insight into the church of Ephesus, the mentoring of Epaphras, and the 19+ churches that were planted from there is expanding my view of the Gospel.\n\nI see Ephesus as “Antioch 2.0.”\n\nPaul staying in one place for two years at the school of Tyrannus [Acts 19:9-10] reminded me of my first taste of leadership training at Hope Chapel in the 1980s. \n\nAll of us who led MiniChurches and our “undershepherds” would meet every other Tuesday night in someone’s living room. Our format, “head, heart, hands,” helped us turn knowledge into action as we read books together. Our mainstay was that “everybody had something to share” [1 Corinthians 14:26]\n\nThe discussions were lively. Sometimes, we passionately disagreed with one another. We were taught early on that whatever we read must be filtered through the Word of God. That was my foundational understanding of apologetics.\n\nOccasionally the book we would read might not have much to do with Christianity, yet the application did. Our first leadership book, In Search of Excellence by Tom Peters, is not rooted in the scriptures but stood firm when we were asked, “What did the Holy Spirit speak to you while you read the chapter?”\n\nWe talked about what was going on in our MiniChurches, coaching each other in navigating challenging situations and constantly being encouraged to develop our undershepherds to plant new MiniChurches.\n\nIt was here that we discovered our church planters. They were the ones who recognized potential leaders and delegated responsibility and authority, producing multiple MiniChurches. A leader planting three MiniChurches became a potential church planter in another town.\n\nThe key is that this happened over time in the security of our home congregation. \n\nYoung people led and pastored the others in their mini churches each week. Then, they returned to the house where leadership training was “consistent, intentional, and relational.” We talked about what went well and what did not. Failure was never final—always an opportunity to “grow forward.”\n\nThe result was a sovereign season of church planting, with thirty churches planted in the first ten years. \n\nI was honored to lead the 30th church plant. When I planted, one of the first things I did was reproduce your living room and the “consistent, intentional, relational” training of MiniChurch Pastors and undershepherds. And we planted thirteen churches locally and globally.\n\nOver time, we developed a five-stage process [the coconut tree] that encapsulated “evangelize,” “organize,” and “deputize.” But that is a story for another time.",

      "body": "This article is an extract from Futureproof by Stephen McAlpine. In the book, Stephen examines secular narratives about purpose and authenticity, connectedness and progress, and compares them to the promises made by the Bible. He shows that the Bible offers a more satisfying, more realistic and more hopeful vision of the future.\n\nFor all of the bad press about the church in recent years, it is the church’s ability (at least theoretically) to deal with conflict through the forgiveness of the gospel that is missing from other forms of community. For relationships to be maintained—indeed, for them to strengthen and flourish over time—we need more than common external interests drawing us together. We need something deep, and something that is beyond our capacity to manufacture, because anything we can manufacture has the habit of wearing out or breaking.\n\nThe church founded by the apostle Paul in the city of Ephesus got off to a rocky start. You can read the story in Acts 19. Paul’s evangelistic endeavours were working well—too well. The townsfolk were turning to Jesus and away from pagan idolatry, and this was starting to affect the local idol-manufacturing business. The manufacturers had to act. They brought charges against Paul of fracturing the city’s unity—and in a sly move, the leader of the agitators, Demetrius, played the religious card:\n\nAnd you see and hear how this fellow Paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in Ephesus and in practically the whole province of Asia. He says that gods made by human hands are no gods at all. There is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be discredited; and the goddess herself, who is worshipped throughout the province of Asia and the world, will be robbed of her divine majesty. (Acts 19 v 26-27)\n\nThe mention of Artemis—also known as Diana of the Ephesians—fanned the flames that Demetrius had fuelled. The temple of Artemis was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. The idol of her image was the temple’s main drawcard.\n\nThis wasn’t simply a case of cultural or artistic pride. Temple worship was the social glue of the ancient world that enabled economic relationships to flourish. Cultural cohesion was necessary to ensure the city hummed along smoothly and flourished financially. In Acts 19, Demetrius pulled the piety lever for self-interested economic reasons. He knew he would see the city’s fortunes decline if Artemis was honoured less than she used to be and Jesus was honoured more. It’s nothing personal, Paul, it’s just business!\n\nThe outrage engendered by Paul’s supposed discrediting of Artemis brought a united reaction—a zealous, vocal, violent, united reaction—from the mob. Like a football crowd at a derby match, they cried out for two solid hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” (v 34). Only the city’s Roman leadership and its love of good order was enough to avert a riot. Not long after, Paul left the city.",
